  ### About Me:

  Hi y'all! :wave: My name is Moriah Lim (pronounced more-RYE-uh LIHM).
  I'm a Senior in Lowell House from North Attleboro, MA who is concentrating in Physics with a Secondary in Educational Studies.
  I'm interested in STEM education and in the learning sciences.
  I'm also passionate about inspiring students to experience the joy of discovery and learning, especially in the problem-solving process, and will be teaching high school physics post-graduation.
